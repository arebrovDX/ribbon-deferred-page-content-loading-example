# WPF RibbonControl - Deferred Page Content Loading

You can load RibbonPage content in the moment a user opens the page. This will speed up your RibbonControl cold and hot startup times.
This approach works the best when your RibbonControl contains multiple RibbonPages with lots of items, galleries, or other heavy-weight content.

Refer to the following documentation topic for more information on the deferred page content loading and its limitations: [Ribbon Performance Enhancements](https://docs.devexpress.com/WPF/403033?v=21.1)
